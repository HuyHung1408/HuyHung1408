### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Fluent Python Calculator. You can always help me when I'm lost <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Pascal. I don't learn Python properly, totally self-study at home due to the Covid pandemic, but somehow I still manage to create a simple calculator with Tkinter <br>
ðŸŒŸ Also don't forget to give my project a star if you like it, it would help me a lot! <br>
ðŸ‘€ Work in progress
