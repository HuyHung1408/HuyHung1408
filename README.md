ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on FluxCalc with my team, Futura Py. You can always help me by contribute to the project <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ~~Python~~, C++. I don't learn Python properly, totally self-study at home due to the Covid pandemic, but somehow I still manage to create a simple calculator with Tkinter <br>
ðŸŒŸ Also don't forget to give my project a star if you like it, it would help me a lot! <br>
